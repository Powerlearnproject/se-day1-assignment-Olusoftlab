#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles and techniques to design, develop, test
and maintain software system. it involves a systematic approach to software development,ensuring that software products are reliable, efficient, and meet the required specifications.

importance of software engineering in the industry

1. Quality and Reliability: Software engineering ensures that software products meet the required standards, are reliable, and perform as expected

2. Efficient development: Software engineering principles and techniques help reduce development time and cost

3. Maintainability: Software engineering makes it easier to maintain and update software systems over time

4. Scalability: Software engineering enables software systems to scale and adapt to changing requirement

5. Innovation: Software engineering enables the development of innovative software solutions that drive technological
advancement

6. Competitive adavantage: Organization that adopt software engineering practices can gain a competitive advantage in the 
market

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Milestones in the evelution of software engineering

1. Development of programming languages

2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s

3. The advent of structured programming languages in the 1970s

4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Software development life-cycle includes

1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs aand system requirement

2. Design: Creating high level and detailed design of software architecture and user interface

3. Implementation: WWriting code and building the software according to the design specification

4. Testing: Conducting various test to ensure that software meets quality atandard and functional requirements

5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers

6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancement to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Comparison between waterfall and agile methodologies

1. Waterfall makes use of a linear approach to problem solving while agile methodology makes use of iterative approach to problem solving

2. Waterfall methodology is low on flexibility while agile methodology is high on flexibility

3. Customer involvement is limited in a waterfall methodology while customer involvement is collaborative in an agile methodology

4. The time to market is long using waterfall methodology and short using an agile methodology 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer: Responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions

Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans

Project manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


Integrated Development Environment: Software suites that provides comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing codes e.g Visual studio, Eclipse, Intellij IDEA

Version control system: Software tool for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members
e,g Gits, and Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenges faced by software engineers includes:

1. Changing requirements

2. Tight deadlines

3. Technical debts

Strategies for overcoming challenges includes:

1. Good commuication

2. Agile methodologies 

3. Priortization of task

4. Regular assessment of project goals and timelines



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


Unit Testing: Testing individual or modules of a software

Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems

System Testing; Testing the entire software system as a whole

Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirement to ensure it meet user needs


Importance of Testing

1. Unit testing allows developers to apply changes with confidence knowing that test will catch any introduce error

2. Integration testing ensures support for regression testing which ensure that changes made to software does not introduce defects or affect existing functionality

3. System testing increases confidence of staheholders ensuring that system works as expected thereby reducing any uncertainty and anxiety

4. Acceptance testing provides crucial information to stakeholders deciding whether to continue or not continue with the deployment




#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


The systematic approach of crafting questions to obtain best optimal response from an artificial intelligence agent is referred to as Prompt engineering.

prompt engineering in relation to interacting with AI models helps learning and aadaptation of the AI model, hence improving the overall performance of the AI model  

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.


Example of vague prompt

1. A house

For specificity, clearity and conciseness the above prompt can be improved by adding context 

Example:

A house with a swimming pool

The improved prompt above is more effective as it gives clearity and add context background in terms of knowing the kind of house being mentioned. This will produce a good response from the AI agent since the prompt is clear, specific and concise.
